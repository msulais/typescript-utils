# TypeScript Utils

A curated collection of utility functions, helper types, and handy code snippets for TypeScript projects. Free to use under the MIT license.

## 🚀 Motivation

I often find myself re-writing the same small utility functions and type definitions across different TypeScript projects. This repository serves as a central, personal toolbox to copy from. By making it public, others can benefit from it too!

## ✨ Features

- **Zero External Dependencies:** No third-party packages required.
- **Self-Contained:** Some utilities may depend on other files within this same repository.
- **MIT Licensed:** Use freely in any project.
- **Well-Typed:** Full TypeScript support with excellent IntelliSense.
- **Easy to Copy:** Organized structure makes it simple to grab what you need.

## 📦 Usage Notes

- Most utilities are standalone and can be copied individually
- Some files may import from other files in this repo (check the imports at the top)
- When copying a file that has imports, make sure to copy the dependent files as well
- All dependencies are internal - no need to install any external packages
